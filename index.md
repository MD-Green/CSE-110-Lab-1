### **Past Projects:**
- World's largest prime number database, allowing the lookup of the Nth prime number, from 1 to 3*10^12, inclusive. The database is stored in S3 buckets and generated by streaming prime numbers via the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
```
def sieve(n):
    flags = numpy.ones(n, dtype=bool)
    flags[0] = flags[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if flags[i]:
            flags[i * i::i] = False
    return numpy.flatnonzero(flags)
```
